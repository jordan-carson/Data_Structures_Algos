    Time complexity of stacks using linked lists

    Notice that if we pop or push an element with this stack, there's no traversal. 
    We simply add or remove the item from the head of the linked list, and update the `head` reference. 
    So with our linked list implementaion, `pop` and `push` have a time complexity of O(1).
    
    Also notice that using a linked list avoids the issue we ran into when we implemented our stack using an array. 
    In that case, adding an item to the stack was fineâ€”until we ran out of space. 
    Then we would have to create an entirely new (larger) array and copy over all of the references from the old array.
    
    That happened because, with an array, we had to specify some initial size 
    (in other words, we had to set aside a contiguous block of memory in advance). 
    But with a linked list, the nodes do not need to be contiguous. 
    They can be scattered in different locations of memory, an that works just fine. 
    This means that with a linked list, we can simply append as many nodes as we like. 
    Using that as the underlying data structure for our stack means that we never run out of capacity, 
    so pushing and popping items will always have a time complexity of O(1).
