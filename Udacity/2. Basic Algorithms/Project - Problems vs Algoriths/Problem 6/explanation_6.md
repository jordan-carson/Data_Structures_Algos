# Problem 6

Is it possible to find the max and min in a single traversal? Obviously, yes. 
I set both the max and min to the first element in the array, and as we traverse each element
I independently compare the max and min within the for loop. Thus, 
this can be completed in one traversal. 

Time Complexity:
O(n)

Space Complexity:
O(1), no additional memory is required.
